# ML-FOR-TARGET-AML
The data for this project was freely obtained from the OCG TARGET Data Matrix, using L3 Gene Expression data and the clinical file for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

IMPORTANT: Some of the data files are in the wrong locations, but running the python notebooks sequentially should work.
